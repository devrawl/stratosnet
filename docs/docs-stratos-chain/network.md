## Network details


=== "Mainnet"

    The documentation corresponding contains details for the RPC - HTTP, WS endpoints. There is also a full node setup if you wish to setup your own full node.

    | Service | Details |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | RPC | https://rpc.thestratos.org/ |
    | REST | https://rest.thestratos.org/ |
    | gRPC | https://grpc.thestratos.org/ |
    | Block Explorer | https://explorer.thestratos.org/ |


=== "Mesos Testnet"

    Mesos Testnet replicates the Stratos Mainnet, which is to be used for testing. Testnet coins are separate and distinct from actual tokens/assets, and are never supposed to have any value. This allows application developers or validators/testers to experiment, without having to use real assets or worrying about breaking the main Stratos chain.
